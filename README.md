# Random Password Generator

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```
## Approach

The project is a simple password generator interface with options for selecting password length and character types. Angular's two-way binding and event handling were used to manage user inputs and dynamically generate passwords based on selected options.

## Assumptions Made
Assumptions made during development include that the user will always select at least one character type, the minimum password length will be 5 characters, and the user will enter a positive integer value for the password length.
